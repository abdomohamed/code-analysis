## Observations from Running Different Models Against the Repository

### Summary Table

- **codellama 7B**: 
    - What I've observed is that if the experiment question has multiple parts, the model would ignore the first parts and only focus on the last part.
    - For e.g. when asked ```What is the complexity of the application and give me the reasons for that?``` it did ignore the complexity part and only answered with what could be the different reasosn for categorizing an application complexity.
